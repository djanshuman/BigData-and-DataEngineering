The UseCase is to predict Churning customers for a Food Order App.
Conditions as below:

The Customer is going to Churn iff:

1. The no of bookings are declining continuously for 3 consecutive months.
2. Each month orders are less than 50% of previous month:

  JUNE 100 
  JULY 30      < 50% OF JUNE
  AUGUST 10    < 50% JULY
  SEPTEMBER 2  < 50% AUGUST
  
3. Capture the feedback details for the customers whose rating is <=3 and whichever feedback is more is number i.e the reason for churning.

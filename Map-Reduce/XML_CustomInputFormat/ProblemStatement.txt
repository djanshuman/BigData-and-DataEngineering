We have a XML file to read and create key,value pairs for mapper. In Normal TextInputFomat class we take the byte offset as key and entire text line
as the value and pass the splits to various mappers.
But in XML file we have start and end tags as well as each line is bounded by tags. If we process them using default TextInputFormat class then
each line will be a separate key,value but generate different key value pairs which is equal to number of lines in input file.

Example:
<MOVIES>
<MOVIE_NAME>Titanic</MOVIE_NAME>
<ACTOR1>Leonardo Di Caprio</ACTOR1>
<ACTOR2>Kate Winslet</ACTOR2>
<GENRE>Drama</GENRE>
<RATINGS>7.7</RATINGS>
<YEAR>1997</YEAR>
</MOVIES>

In above example if we parse using default format then it will produce as below:
0  <MOVIES>
8 <MOVIE_NAME>Titanic</MOVIE_NAME>
so on...

But our requirement is as below:
0	Titanic,Leonardo Di Caprio,Kate Winslet,Drama,7.7,1997

So we have to create our own InputFormatClass to parse the dataset. Based on usecase the InputFormat class will vary.

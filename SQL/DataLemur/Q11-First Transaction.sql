Assume you're given a table containing Etsy user transactions. Write a query that retrieves the customers whose first transaction was valued at $50 or more. Output the total number of users who meet this criteria.

Instructions:

To determine the first transaction for each user, use the transaction_date field.
Take into account scenarios where a user had multiple transactions on the same day. Use a specific function (we can't give too much away ğŸ˜‰) to handle these cases and correctly identify the first transaction.
Effective June 14th, 2023, the solution and hints have been revised.

user_transactions Example Input:
transaction_id	user_id	spend	transaction_date
759274	111	49.50	02/03/2022 00:00:00
850371	111	51.00	03/15/2022 00:00:00

248475	156	87.00	04/16/2022 00:00:00
  
Example Output:

The LinkedIn Creator team is looking for power creators who use their personal profile as a company or influencer page. This means that if someone's Linkedin page has more followers than all the company they work for, we can safely assume that person is a Power Creator. Keep in mind that if a person works at multiple companies, we should take into account the company with the most followers.

Write a query to return the IDs of these LinkedIn power creators in ascending order.

Assumptions:

A person can work at multiple companies.
In the case of multiple companies, use the one with largest follower base.
This is the second part of the question, so make sure your start with Part 1 if you haven't completed that yet!

Write a query to determine which type of place (place_category) attracts the most UGC tagged as "off-topic". In the case of a tie, show the output in ascending order of place_category.

Assumptions:

Some places may not have any tags.
Each UGC upload with the "off-topic" tag will be counted separately.
